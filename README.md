# Banking Bulk messaging system Automation Framework

## Overview
Banking Bulk Messaging System Automation Framework is a test automation framework developed for the Banking Bulk Messaging System. It is built using Selenium WebDriver with Java, Cucumber for BDD (Behavior-Driven Development), and TestNG for test execution. The framework is designed to ensure efficient and scalable regression testing. Through this project, more than 100 scenarios have been automated.

## Features
- **Selenium WebDriver** for UI automation
- **Cucumber BDD** for test case readability and maintainability
- **TestNG** for test execution and reporting
- **Page Object Model (POM)** for structured and reusable test scripts
- **Parallel Execution** support via TestNG
- **Cross-browser testing** Chrome,Firefox

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later**
   - Download: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
   - Verify installation:

     ```
3. **IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse** (for IDE)
4. **Selenium WebDriver** (included in Maven dependencies)
5. **Cucumber and TestNG** (managed via Maven dependencies)
6. **App-specific test data** (to be provided based on the telco applications being tested)
